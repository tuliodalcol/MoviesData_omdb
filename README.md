# CASE-STUDY-1---Movies-Data

### Description
We want you to implement a REST API that, given a movie or series title, returns the results available in the OMDb API, which is a RESTful web service to obtain that information.
We will positively evaluate it if you develop it in Python.

### Brief
We need a software application in charge of returning the main and necessary data given a movie or series title so that later our Data Analysts team would be able to extract information about the preferences of the viewers.
What we don’t know yet is how the final users will interact with the tool and how much it will grow in the future.

##### Instructions
- OMDb API reference: http://www.omdbapi.com/.
- Please generate your API Key through this form (choose the free account type).
- You can test it through HTTP access. For example:
 http://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY&s=dragon%20ball
○ http://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY&i=tt0214341
- Send us back your solution in any format you wish (a zip file via email or cloud service, a
hosting link for software development as GitHub, etc.). In any case, keep it private.
- Please share with us any comments we would need to know in order to run your application.
